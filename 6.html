		<i>On the train, Somewhere 2018</i>
		<p>Long train rides doesn't feel very long with you. Just like long car rides. I enjoy every bit of our carpool karaoke. I love how you try to sing every single part of the song when you don't even know the proper lyrics HAHAHA. Maybe you're innovative, most people sing lyrics, you sing music WOW. Thailand's got talent mhai kub. </p>
		<p>Although we didn't sing on the train, I did enjoy balancing you head on my shoulder. You probably don't remember but I tried really hard to keep your head steady on my shoulder to make sure you didn't have bad dreams.</p>
		<p>I also put my head on your head and think really hard about how much I love you so that you'll know that I love you without me having to wake you up to tell you. Pretty sure it works. </p>
