		<i>Aei's House, Bangkok 2018</i>
		<p>It's best buddddd. Thank you Aei for introducing me to Kaitom. You made two best bois happy. And us best bois are also happy when we make you happy. </p>
		<p>I hope Kaitom is doing well without me. Does he miss me? Does he wonder what happened to his best bud? I wish Kaitom could speak. We probably will fight each other about who loves Aei more. I think I'll win tho or maybe we'll tie. </p>
		<p>Can you give kaitom his kanoms for meee. Tell him P Smile fark ma haii. Make him sit, handshake, and mhorb first na kub. And tell him I miss him too.</p>
