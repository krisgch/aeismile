		<i>On the train to Windermere 2018</i>
		<p>This picture reminds me of our first train ride together. The one to Thorpe Park. Back then you were a fresher and I was an old 3rd yr who still goes to Thorpe Park just because he wants to get to know a certain fresher. Das you. </p>
		<p>I remember looking at you a lot on the train. I tried to impress you by pranking someone with wasabi. Probably not the best method back then, not the best at this kub hahaha. Then I remember trying to get onto rides with you to get closer to you. Finally I succeeded in convincing you to get on the SAW ride! </p>
		<p>Sorry I scared you from going on other rollercoasters ever again hahaha. But it felt amazing when you trust me enough to get on that ride, plus it was so funny when we get our pictures back. </p>
