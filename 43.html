		<p>Dis my fav flower. Blooms every morning. OK now that I think about it, saying the first sentence in English is probably the correct choice. </p>
		<p>Have you thought about doing hair modeling for Loreal or Pantene? I think your hair looks sooo perfect in this pic. I've always thought your hairstyle is so so nice. And woahhh this pic proves me right. Why's that bit on the bottom different color thoo? (I can't tell what color it is) It's sooooo cooooool. </p>
		<p>You with sunglasses is also cool sas. </p>
