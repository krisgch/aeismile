		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>I really love this pic! Korbkun kub. Appreciate the precise focusing and great photo composition. This picture makes the hike up worthwhile. Meeting dogs along the way does too.</p>
		<p>Remember that poodle-ish dog with the chubby couple that took all the wrong turn and ended up reaching the top after us? The dog reminds me of peanut so much. God that lil monter makes dog sitting the most tiring job in the world. It's a shame that he's been sent to the country side. </p>
		<p>Anyways, I think our dogs are so much better. I heard about a certain saying somewhere that.. </p>
<p>"All owners think they have the best dog in the world, and none of the are wrong" </p>
<p>Say hello to Kaitom for me! Hope the two of you are happy and healthy kub.</p>
