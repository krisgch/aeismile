		<p>What were we doing on that day? Was it 'Book of Mormon'? Probably not. Were we getting the film developed after our Colombia Road Market? I don't remember, but there are so many different memories in this picture. Not far ahead is 'Caf√© De Paris', on of our first Abaqus event. I specifically go because I want to get to know you. And you let me! By trusting (crying) and telling me your stories. Thank you very much naaa aei. </p>
		<p>If it weren't for that day I would never think I have a shot with you. </p>
		<p>Not only did you let me take care of you that day, but you also sat with me at 97 after! I was soooooo happy you know. Glad we had that night. Love you kub. </p>
