		<p>Hi aei and the big weird looking flower. I hope you liked the flowers I gave you on your graduation day. Ofc you did! Aei tue kae korng raooooo. Dee jaiii. Sucks for everyone else but I don't careeee. Suu flowers rao mai dai. Orn ae gor pae paii. </p>
		<p>I got those flowers from wild at heart t nottinghill gate (10 min walk from the station). Went to the store to hand pick what looks good and told them to help me make it look wild wild foresty looking. Then torn ja pay they said me 10 pounds delivery cost so I decided I'll just go in the morning and pick the flowers up myself. Cos I wanna save some money. </p>
		<p>So I took a tube there and back. It was raining. Cost me abt 5 GBP for tube. Should've asked for delivery HAHAHAHA. Sometimes I not the best decision maker. </p>
		<p>Anyways, glad the flowers ork ma suay and glad you liked them. I protect them with life tung tae sue jon haii aei. </p>
