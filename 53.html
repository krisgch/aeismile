			<i>Some Restaurant in Portobello Market, London 2018</i>
			<p>Hi my wher wher girlfriend. This is almost like the face you make when you can't decide which food to order.
			Except, that face includes lip licking and intense smiling hahaha. Ooo this reminds me of the time I told you to pick one of the hois so you picked two.</p>
			<p>One of each is the way to live! Except fan, one is enough na kub and that one is ME.</p>
			<p>I think we took this at a restaurant near portobello road market before we go to columbia road flower market. That was one good day right?? You got flowerss. We took pics. We got our pictures back. Everybody happy and in love.
			Let's have one of these day again. I love you kub. See you soon.</p>
