		<p>Although this is not a picture of us, I really like this picture. The glare from the sun is just enough. The reflection of the sun on the water doesn't blind us. The way these two random strangers look like couple, makes me think of the times we were still strangers and now we know each other better than we know ourselves. The way the dude's face looks so confusing reminds me of the times you were mad and I didn't know what I did wrong. So sorry about those times HAHAHA. </p>
		<p>Never meant to do that. I do love that feeling of knowing that you still love me after we made up tho. But sunya ja mai tum hai aei grode boi na kub. Really really love you. Thanks for tolerating with me. </p>
