		<i>Granger & Co. London 2018</i>
		<p>It was a sunny day in London. We were going to get our hotcakes at Granger & Co. after you helped me picked my mom's bday present. We were waiting in the queue when something amazing happens. 'Baby twins in a stroller, twin waiter, and twin smile'. I don't know why but I guess amazing things do happen whenever I'm with you.</p>

		<p>I think you're such a model material in this pic</p>

		<p>And of course I'm such a model's boyfriend/photographer  material</p>
