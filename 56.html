		<p>Sorry about the pose. I didn't know how to take normal pictures back then. But now I know kub, bus station picture taught me. Appreciate you still taking my pictures hahaha. </p>
		<p>I guess I was just trying to match the extra-ness of the group of Khun pas wearing Thai dress. Very yorn yook, very extra, which we could be just as extra when we're old. I think we can. Pretty sure I'll probably grow up to be a cool grandpa, if not then definitely the embarrassing but funny grandpa. </p>
