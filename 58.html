		<p>CUTEEEEEEEEEE</p>
		<p>I can never get over how cute you are. Both when you're happy and sad. You used to say that you're not always happy and you didn't think I'd be able to handle the sad Aei. Been over a year now, guess I can hahaha.
Just wanna let you know that I will love you no matter if you happy or sad. I love the way you laugh at everything, and think that everything I do is funny, when all I did was be normal (my normal). I also love when you are sensitive and cry. I mean I don't enjoy it like sa jai, I mean I think it's cute that you are able to truly show your emotions with me. That time that you cry when you listened to Bodyslam! Makes me love you even more, cos I know that when you feel something, you really feel it. Which means you defo feel my LOVEE.</p>
