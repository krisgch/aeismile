		<i>Saatchi Gallery, London 2018</i>
		<p>This pic was taken outside Saatchi gallery after we ate our... I don't even know what it is.. Some meat in buns.. Not the best but the oysters were sooooo refreshing.</P>
		<p>Looking at this makes me think of the times when we were still shy. When we kept our feelings to ourselves. Makes me wish I had the courage to ask if the seat next to you is taken.. Can I sit next to you? Can I stay here and make you laugh? </p>
		<p>Guess it all works out in the end. You have no choice but to laugh now. Hope I don't trouble you na kub. </p>
