		<p>Wow it's the puad tong face, still cute. If this is your puad tong face, it's my "bao bao noi na tik na" face. Glad you're not watching him right now hahaha. 4 po dum is good, you can watch 4 po dum. </p>
		<p>Why's that bit of hair sticking out so much. I guess it's better to have hair sticking out than not having any. Cries. </p>
		<p>Love them cheeks too. God I miss your cheekssssss. Lemme rub them when I get out of the military. I'll be dreaming of your cheeks everyday, so sad. </p>
