		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>This is a picture of my girlfriend, Aei (left), and a swan. Both beautiful, both hungry, both hangry at times but lovely always. </p>
		<p>Except I think the swan is a dude. He seems to like us though, he circles us so many times. Probably happy to be around us. </p>
		<p>Just like many people, especially waiters. I think our ability to continuously make people around us happy is a sign that we should be together and make this world a better place. Probably not a good idea to leave me now.</p>
		<p>NOPE. SWAN DOESN'T THINK SO. </p>
