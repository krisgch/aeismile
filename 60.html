		<P>I remember why I took this pic! I thought it looks like you're wearing a tiara. You should be cos you won Miss Smile Universe year 2017-year forever. </p>
		<p>Definitely the most important contest in the world I tell you. </p>
		<p>Are you honored? At least I hope you're not ashamed HAHAHAH. Since the prize is me, and it's winner takes all. Congratulations kub. Please take good care of the prize as it can be sensitive from time to time. But most of the time it functions well, and can do most of the things to want it to do. Except 'ta cream'. Working on that. Oh wait, it works now. WOO Congrats to Aei again. </p>
