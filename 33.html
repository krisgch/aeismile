		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>This photo looks like its taken out of an anime or something. It's like we were at the top of the mountain, and anything could be on the other side. Are you wondering what's on the other side of the mountain? Go take a peek si kub. Don't be afraid to take a peek unless you're next to the men's bathroom, then you better be very afraid. Especially in the UK, the things in there are just nightmare materials. </p>
		<p>Anyways, I think this pic helps me encourage you to do whatever it is you're doing right now to your best ability! OK maybe I'm just random. SUSU na kub!!</p>
