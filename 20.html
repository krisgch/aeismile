		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>There we go here's a portrait picture for you. I know you like it. I'm writing this with a sad piano playing in the background. Makes this picture much more emotional that just a group of duck swimming around the lake. Makes it feel like the distance between me and you is so so so farrrr and that I can't reach you no matter how much I try. In fact you're sleeping when I'm writing this so it's pretty much impossible to reach you now. Anyways, there goes my effort of being emotional with this picture. I swear I get more emotional with other picture. And I get a lot more emotional after I met you. You taught me the strength of showing emotions. I always treat everything as a joke to avoid any real emotion, which is why I tend to make jokes when we were having serious discussions I think. Sorry about those times kub. I'm so much better now that I'm with you. I really did cry a whole lot when I didn't know how to help you with your depression. I guess I really am much stronger now. </p>
