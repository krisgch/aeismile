		<p>There is something cute about this picture. Not just you scratching your butt but something else.
		To me, it feels like you're going on a journey. Alone, a strong independent girl who needs no man but wants a Smile.
		That's who I think you are! I hope I can be there to help you with anything but I can't, not yet. I hope you're staying strong na kub.</p>
		<p>Please come visit me sooooon, unless you're reading this when you've already visited me then... Thank you for visiting me kub. Appreciate the love mak.</p>
		<p>Aei kem kang na kub. I know you can do anything once you put your mind into it, or anything if you really like it. Find that thing! I'm rooting for you from far far away (from next to you soon soon)</p>
