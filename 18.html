		<p>Why do you love portrait so much? </p>
		<p>Landscape is so niceeeee, landscape let's you focus on everything that's happening around the picture. You can only get a few things with portrait, the rest is just the sky and water. Maybe it's because I don't see the real color of the sky, oh no... Sorry kub, I'm disabled. 'Phorgasm' makes me realise the awesomeness of portrait. I swear I will take more portrait pictures, if you promise to be in them. I only taking pictures with you in it. </p>
		<p>Hope you're enjoying this gallery of landscapes HAHAHAHA. Please don't delete me... </p>
