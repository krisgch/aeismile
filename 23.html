		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>WOWS another portrait. I remember taking a similar pic but I still took this pic because you LOVEE portrait pictures HAHAH. But now I like portraits too.</p>
		<p>"Couples who grow to love similar things will stay together forever" â€“ Smile 2018<p>
		<p>Wise words from the wisest man I've ever spoken too. Please ignore the fact that I've spoken to myself. Just trust on those words.</p>
		<p>I really miss our little trip to Lake District. Thinking back it really felt like we were two people completely separated from the rest of the world. We were two people in our own little world and that felt really really nice. Does that mean all I need in my world is you? Woahhhhhhhh.... It does right? </p>
