		<p>This picture is so youuuuu. Confused but cute. This was right after we bought the flowers right? </p>
		<p>Wish I had the color glasses when we went to this market. Imagine all the colors I've missed out on. Now I really want that glasses. What if all along what I see is completely different from what you see. Maybe purple looks really really nice but I just don't see it. OK it's getting too depressing hahahaha. </p>
		<p>I think my colorblindness is probably not that bad, cos I still see many colors. Now I'm making the same pose you make in this picture, scratching my head cos I'm confused about what I'm really seeing hahah. But you're beautiful with or without colorblind glasses so it's all good.  </p>
		<p>OMG is that Mr.Gray on the right</p>
