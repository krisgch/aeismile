		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>Bet you're thinking, "What kind of animal is that?". What do you think Kaitom's reaction will be if he has to fight a tractor. I think he'll bork so loud the tractor stops working, cos Kaitom is a really good boi who's also 'na greng kam'. Good boi best bud. </p>
		<p>I wish we could take Kaitom to a big open field. Let him run around with us (or me). We can play fetch with his carrot baeb tem t, I will throw it so hard it takes Kaitom 30 minutes to get it back. This way we'll get 30 minutes of zen. JK kub, love us 3 together. </p>
		<p>I can really picture us three together in this picture. Bet, it'll so problematic but we'll be so happy. </p>
