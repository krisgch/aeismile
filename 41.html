		<p>Can I order vanilla ? HAHAHHA I know you hate me every time I order vanilla ice cream. Too plain for you right hahaha. I guess I'm just the sort of person who likes one thing and just keep liking that same thing over and over again. Maybe that's what makes me such a good boyfriend (maybe you hate me even more now hahaha). </p>
		<p>I do like to order new stuff now because of you. You're the type to get bored of doing the same thing again and again. You introduced me to the joy of trying something completely different. Thanks for showing me that side of the world kub. But don't get bored of me and go try something new, cos I tell u... </p>
		<p>I'm da best boi. </p>
		<p>Ah I remember now! you were mad at me cos I asked you which flavours good and I ordered Vanilla anyway. Won't do that again hahahaha. Love you kub. </p>
