		<p>What are you thinking about now? Are you thinking about me? I think about you everyday kubb. If you're wondering about what I'm doing right now, I'm probably working on getting that six pack so you can fruebbs fruebs all you want. </p>
		<p>Hopefully, you're reading this when I'm already in the military service. Cos if not then it'd be weird cos I'm definitely not working out when I'm writing this. I'm sitting in a car otw to bkk hospital. </p>
