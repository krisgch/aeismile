		<p>That's your signature card holderrrr. I remember we almost lost it in the tube, the workers were going crazy about your card holder. So lucky we got it back yey. </p>
		<p>Why did you have those flowers squashed between your books again? I did something similar with the flowers you gave me on my graduation. It looked really really nice so I told mom I wanna bring it home. So mom disassemble it, dried it, and worked her magic. Pretty sure mom thought it was beautiful too, all those weird flowers. Hope you liked the flowers I gave you on your graduation na kub. </p>
