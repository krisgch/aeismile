		<p>Kayun junggg. I hope you're having a good time na kub. Hope you're working hard but not too hard. Hard enough to make you feel happy about working. But not too hard jon too 'nhuey'. Doolae health tua eng duay na Aei. I can't be there to take care of you physically but I'm always there spiritually na kub. You can feel me in every gingmile.</p>
		<p>Also, before I went away, I told kaitom to bork everytime I misses you and everytime I wanna say I love you gor hai kaitom bork instead. I also told kaitom to hai gumlung jai aei yer yer, I think he took that as more borks. Anyways, just remember that all the borks are good borks. Hope kaitom borks. </p>
