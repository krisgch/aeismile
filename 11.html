		<p>Hi again. It's me Smile you best boi. I miss you so muchhhhhhhhhh. </p>
		<p>This is one of the best photo I've ever taken. Best photo = photo with you (or your feet) in it. You said you liked the feeling of dipping your shoes in the water but I think you're lowkey washing the dirt off your shoes. At least it's what I would do if my shoes weren't flyknit. </p>
		<p>I remember the feelings I had when I took this photo. It was the same feelings I had when I helped you with 'Photograph' dance. The feeling of being satisfied with making you happy from far away. Funny how taking a photo makes me think of photograph (Ok that sounds extremely normal). </p>
		<p>I hope you're happy. I hope you're enjoying the little details in life. I hope you miss me. I hope I can see you sooooooon. I love you so much kub.</p>
