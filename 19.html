		<p>"How you doing?" – Joey Tribiani </p>
		<p>Are you eating well? Are you on a diet? Are you sleeping well? Are you happy? Is Kaitom happy? I miss you. </p>
		<p>The dude in the picture is me trying to escape from the military service and paddle to you. I wish there's a river close by so I kayak along แม่น้ำเจ้าพระยา  and run to you. I don't know how long until I get out as I don't order these pictures HAHAHAH. I just write them by my feelings so... Anyways I hope you're happy and I hope to see you soooooooon (with hat). </p>
