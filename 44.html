		<i>Columbia Road Flower Market, London 2018</i>
		<p>Wow you really like the flowers we bought from the market. Du di, len phone gor mai ploi flower. Oh wow and you match the flowers we bought toooo. I just noticed this, holy. Your skirt and shirt matches that the blue flower (I think it's blue). If not then just know that you matches with the flower and you look really good in my eyes. </p>
		<p>See that's perks of dating a colorblind. I always think that you match this and that, when the color is not the same, just similar. I love my colorblindness a little bit more now. </p>
