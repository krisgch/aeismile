		<p>Wow such a beautiful constellation. I think this side of you is the best side. As good as the other side. Love both your sides. Love all of you. Much love. </p>
		<p>This pic was taken at the caf√© next to kiew kaii gaa. Mom told me so many times to take you there. She must really like you cos she been giving me lot of dates advice and she never gives advice to smart or to me before. Maybe she wants a loog sao. WOWS. I think she does hahahaha. </p>
