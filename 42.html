		<i>Columbia Road Flower Market, London 2018</i>
		<p>Finally we get to go to Columbia Road Flower Market after a long time of saying we want to go. It was sooooo tiring hahaha. But glad we went, I enjoyed it kub. Except carrying the heavy flower part and the losing my camera case tightener part, that day was really really nice. </p>
		<p>This picture was when we finished our shopping and sat down on grass in the garden with sunbathing farangs next to us. Gotta say it was sooo relaxing, the sitting down chilling part, not the seeing old shirtless farangs part.</p>
		<p>Miss going on adventures with you kub. </p>
