		<i>Oxenholme Station, Oxenholme 2018</i>
		<p>Waiting for our train ride to London from Windermere, Lake District. </p>

		<p>You were reading 'Little fires everywhere' (I think)</p>
		<p>I was walking around <br>
			I went to say hi to goats and take pics of them <br>
			I bought food <br>
			I took this picture <br>
			I walk to sit with you </p>

		<p>How did you deal with this energetic ball?</p>
