		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>View from our Airbnb room in Windermere. Luckily it didn't rain the whole time we were there. </p>
		<p>I think you're really good at planning trips. Without you I'd be stuck in London. What will I do without you. I don't want to be stuck in one place. Please don't leave me. </p>
		<p>Let's go to beautiful places together. Let's enjoy the world together. Let's meet goodbois like Zach together (maybe not exactly like Zach, goodbois don't have to step on my foot. Hurts). </p>
		<p>Let's keep being happy together. </p>
