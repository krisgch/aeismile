	<p>Thanks for taking my pics. I never have any cool pictures of myself. Kinda want some for dp. And this works. I like taking pics of you more than being in the pic alone tho. Pics look so good with you in them. You should be in all my pics. With me and alone, both great. With me better cos our love makes any picture better. WOWWWW. Miss you na kub.</p>
	<p>You know everytime I post a pic that was taken by you or of you, I always get more likes. And the pics with both of us woah, most likes. I think people agree that we should be together. And I think people are right. Gotta please the people and be together kub. JK ta people mai yak hai yu duay gun gor tong screw the people, yak yu gub Aei kub.</p>
	<p>Hope you're doing well na. Really really miss you. Hope I can see you again real soon.</p>
