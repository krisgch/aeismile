		<i>On the train to Windermere 2018</i>
		<p>You woke up from your train nap! </p>
		<p>This picture has such a good composition. Focusing is also on point. Why is this picture so good. Is it my skills? Am I a pro photographer? Is it because you make it easy for me to take good pictures? </p>
		<p>I think it's the last one. You have so many good angles that it's so easy to take good pictures of you. Did you realise I was taking this picture? I don't remember. But I remember that I was thinking to myself about how beautiful you were through the camera lens. I was like 'Woahhhh, das my gf, tum mai suay ngee, gotta keep this moment forever'. So I took the picture. Sorry if I annoyed you when I tried to take too many pics of you when you didn't really want to. I just wanted something save this moment for when we're old and forgetful. (OK just old, we're already forgetful) </p>
