		<i>Saatchi Gallery, London 2018</i>
		<p>Thank you for making me want to invite you to art gallery to look at the most beautiful art in the world (you). Srsly, we can do that anywhere... (I do love going to museums and gallery with you tho)</p>
		<p>I love how happy you look when you think a pattern is cute. Sometimes I don't know how a pattern can be cute. But this side of you that see's the good side to anything is what I really love about you. You should use that side of you on yourself more, "U CUTE". </P>
