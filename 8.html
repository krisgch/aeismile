		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>You took this picture! Wows. Much love. Much appreciation. I love this pic. If only it was you next to me instead of the swan. Not in the water na kub. I mean like sitting next to me on the pier. Don't go boongboong like a fish. </p>
		<p>Watching the sunset with you is something I want to do everyday. God the swan is so annoying, I'm trying to write something nice and sweet here, why do I have to feel like I'm being watched and judged. Anyways, I wish some days in the future we can sit and watch our sunsets peacefully again, although I probably won't see much of the color but you're the only color I want to see. AW SNAP DAMN SON SMILE DOES IT AGAIN. </p>
		<p>Love you kub.</p>
