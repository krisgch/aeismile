		<i>Aei's house, Bangkok 2018</i>
		<p>One of my proudest moment was when you managed to teach Kaitom to mhorb. So gooood. Shows how much Kaitom loves you and how much Kaiton is willing to do for food HAHAHAHAH. </p>
		<p>I enjoyed every bit of our lesson with Kaitom. 3 of us spending time together makes me realise that in the end what I want is for us to be happy together kub. </p>
		<p>Let's work towards that together norrrrr. I miss you kub. Looking forward to 3 of us spending time together again. Teach him rolls!! </p>
