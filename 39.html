		<p>Focus, determination, and attention to details, those are some of the things I saw whenever I sit on a boyfriend chair. Waiting for you at cosmetics stores were never boring. Do you know whyyyy? Cos you are always so happy and I just love seeing the happy aei. Remember that time in Emquartier, when you suddenly get mad at something I don't even remember what. We were going down an escalator and I noticed that you went quiet so I asked if you wanted to go to this 3CE store. You went in, bought something in like 5 minutes, and you were back to happy mode again. </p>
		<p>Not saying that I totally support this habit hahahaa but it was kind of a funny story. Love you loads thoo. </p>
