		<p>Waiting for food was never boring with you. Waiting for anything actually. I guess time just flies when we're together. I wish I could wait for you to get ready with you so it wouldn't feel very long HAHAHAHAHA. Lorlen kub. Love you. So much please don't kill me when I get out of the military service.</p>

		<p>I can always wait for you to get ready cos I love those little heart attacks I get when I see the product of your effort (you). This is so not about this pic. I love you.</p>
