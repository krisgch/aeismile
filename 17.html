		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>Finally we get to go on our adventure outside London. Thanks to you finding the best Airbnb. I'm glad you enjoyed our walks to the ice cream shops and our dogseeing around the city. </p>
		<p>Maybe it's the Studio Ghibli playing the background while I'm writing this or maybe it's the mood of this picture, but I think this picture of a beautiful sunset and an even more beautiful Aei makes me feel like any bad things during the day can be washed away by a good ending to the day.</p>
		<p>Tbh the sun can go set somewhere else, with you next to me I feel like everyday will be a good day.  </p>
