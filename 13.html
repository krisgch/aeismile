		<p>You're the only one who can pull off this pose. Probably because normal people don't do this too but mainly because you're super super cute. How you manage to look cute with this pose I'll never know. Oh wait I do, cos you're cute. What's that? Did I hear you say "รู้อยู่แล้ว"? </p>
		<p>Dee jai na t aei dai pen tua kong tua eng waelar rao yu duay gun. Rao gor dai pen tua kong tua eng. A bit too much at times but you'll have to deal with me. Korbkun t ruk rao baeb t rao pen. Ruk aei baeb t aei pen muen gun na kub, my little ball of sensitivity. </p>
