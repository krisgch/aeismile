		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>There's just something calming about this picture. I can't really explain it. Maybe it's the way the moon says hello to us even when the sun hasn't really set yet. It's a little happy seeing two objects that were not meant to see each other managed to be together, even for a short while. If these two can do it, then us two who definitely belongs together can definitely do anything! OMG so pumped! </p>
		<p>Just a short encouragement to get you through anything in the world! SUSU in whatever you're doing kub. I'm always here for you (when I get out). </p>
