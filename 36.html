		<i>Windermere, Lake District 2018</i>
		<p>This is one my fav pic. The tone looks nice, very filmy and the composition is just on point. 3 layers: blurred front, blurred back, and focused on you. Just like how I see the world everyday! Probably why I keep forgetting where I park too HAHAHAH. </p>
		<p>I'll just say it again that I think your bag is super cool, very poonum trend kub. A good prop to my photos too. </p>
		<p>Was this when we took a detour to try to find a better way down from the mountain. I think this was when we found the stairs but you couldn't climb it cos of your period hahaha. Sry about all our detours inside and outside the parking lot. I'll take pictures now. </p>
		<p>Love you kub.  </p>
