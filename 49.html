		<p>I remember you said you really really like this pictureeeee. I'm so glad you like it. Your reaction when we get the pictures back from snappysnaps was just so cute. It's the reason why I love taking pictures. Now that I think about it, whenever I'm not with you, I don't have the same urge to walk around and take pics. I do enjoy it from time to time, but I think making you happy is one of the main reasons I do many of the things I do. Do worry about me not being happy, cos I'm always happy doing all these things, never once was it against my will kub. Except eating veggies, and that strong chocolate ice cream, god that was so bad. </p>
		<p>Thanks for letting me take a picture of you. </p>
		<p>Wish the bald dude wasn't in this picture tho. Such a dp material. </p>
